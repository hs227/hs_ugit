branch: Create new branch

tag just the alias of the oid.but branch attached with HEAD,can move with HEAD when commit.
!!HEAD in '.ugit/HEAD'
!!tags in '.ugit/refs/tags/'
!!branch in '.ugit/heads/'

!!if we checkout a branch by name, we'll do something different, we will update HEAD to point to the name of the branch!
HEAD points to branch rather than the OID of the commit directly.
To mirror Git's terminology, we will call a ref that points to another ref a "symbolic ref".
