  Aim: Fetch the objects
  In 'data.py':
    'fetch_object_if_missing' to conditionally copy objects from remote repo by oid
  In 'base.py':
    'iter_objects_in_commits' list of the reachable objects
    ?? before accessing, give the caller a chance to fetch it if missing
  In 'remote.py':
    in here, we just need to iterate all objects and fetch the missing
}
