show: Print diff of commit
from: https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#show-diff

from:Nikita
Instead of just printing the changed files in a commit, let's print the actual diff (diff is the format with pluses and minuses at the beginning of the line).
'diff_blobs()' take two blob OIDs and return the diff between them.
'diff'(an external Unix utility) receives two files as arguments and prints the differences between them in diff format.
We'll need to read the blobs from the object database and write them to a temporary file, which will be given to "diff" utility.
"diff"'s output is a byte string.(passed some extra options (--unified, --show-c-function, --label))

difflib is a great alternative


from:leaving_knife
I will chose a similar tool to take place of the 'diff',so that i can still use the "PIPE".
1.Meld or KDiff3 are GUI tool,and i don't know how to get text.
  ->failed
2.I try to write a difflike application in python(using difflib).
And then i will use the PIPE to communicate with this application.
  ->successed
  (absolute path needed)
