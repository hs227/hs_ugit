fetch: Print remote refs
from: https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#print-remote-refs


from:Nikita
{
'fetch': download refs and associated objects from a remote reposity.
Note that the remote master ref is namespaced under "remote/" to distinguish it from my master.
Next, if I want to synchronize my master I can do ugit merge remote/master (Assuming that HEAD points to master).
}
{
  Aim:List all refs on the remote reposity
  s1:change GIT_DIR
  s2:use the 'iter_refs("refs/heads")' to iter all branches
}
{
  'remote.py' mode for remote synchronization code.
  Here we will only code for local computer.
  filesystem-based remotes will illustrate the important concepts just as well.
}

I will try to add the SSH or HTTP support like real GIT in the furture.
