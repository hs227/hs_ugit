show: List changed files in commit
from: https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#show-changed-files


from:Nikita
We will compare the tree of the commit to the tree of its parent commit.
'diff.py':deals with computing differences between objects
'diff.compare_trees()':will take a list of trees and will return them grouped by filename.
'diff.diff_trees()':takes two trees, compares them and return all entries that have different OIDs.
Then what is left is to call diff_trees() from show with the correct trees (of the commit we want to show and its parent).
