fetch: Download remote ref values

Just note that the remote commit is still missing from my object store, so refs/remote/master points to a non-existing object and any attempts to use it will cause an error.
We're going to fix the error in the next change.

Note that real Git supports multiple remotes, and each remote has a name. For example, if there is a remote named "origin", its branches would go under refs/remote/origin/. But in ugit we assume for simplicity that there's only one remote and just put its branches under refs/remote/.
