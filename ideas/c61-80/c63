push: Don't allow force push
from:https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#push-dont-allow-force

from:Nikita
allow pushing only in two cases:
 *The ref that we're pushing doesn't exist yet on the remote. It means that it's a new branch and there is no risk of overwriting other's work.
 *If the remote ref does exist, it must point to a commit that is an ancestor of the pushed ref. This ancestry means that the local commit is based on the remote commit, which means that the remote commit not getting overwritten, since it's part of the history of the newly pushed commit.
