diff: Add --cached option and take index into account
from: https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#diff-use-index

from: Nikita
'diff':
  *If no arguments are provided, diff from the index to the working directory. This way you can quickly see unstaged changes.
  *If --cached was provided, diff from HEAD to the index. This way you can quickly see which changes are going to be commited.
  *If a specific commit was provided, diff from the commit to the index or   working director (depending on whether --cached was provided).
