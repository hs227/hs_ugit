write-tree: Write from the index instead of the working directory

from:Nikita
 First, we need the convert the index, which is a flat list of files, to a tree of dictionaries.
 Second,we will call write_tree_recursive() which is basically the same as the old write_tree(), but instead of operating on the filesystem it will work with the tree of dicts and write them to the objects store.

I feel sorry about it, but our pattern of index already listed by tree.
