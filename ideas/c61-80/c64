add:Record added files in the index
from: https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#add-files-to-index


from:Nikita
the index:allow finer grained control over commited files.
The flow will look like this:
  *The user modifies some files in the working directory.
  *For each file that the user wishes to commit, he will run ugit add path/to/file. ugit will put the file into the object database and remember its OID in the index. The index is a dictionary that maps filenames to their last remembered OID. The index will be saved as a JSON file in the .ugit directory so that we can persist it between invocations of ugit.
  *The user runs ugit commit, at which point write-tree will take the contents of the index and write it to a tree object. Since the index maps file names to OIDs, just like a tree object, the conversion will be easy.
