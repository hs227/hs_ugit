why 'data/'?
{
I want to have some separation between different logical parts of the code:

cli.py - In charge of parsing and processing user input.
data.py - Manages the data in .ugit directory. Here will be the code that actually touches files on disk.
}

about "LAB_GIT_DIR=CUR_DIR+GIT_DIR" in data.h?
just for run and test
